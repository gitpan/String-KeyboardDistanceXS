String::KeyboardDistanceXS Rdpfp Approximate String Comparison                KRBURTON


Approximate string comparison.


NAME
    String::KeyboardDistanceXS - String Comparison Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
      use String::KeyboardDistanceXS qw( :all );
      my $s1 = 'Apple';
      my $s2 = 'Wople';

      # compute a match probability
      my $pr = qwertyKeyboardDistanceMatch($s1,$s2);

      # find the keyboard distance between two strings
      my $dst = qwertyKeyboardDistance('IBM','HAL');

DESCRIPTION
    This is an XS implementation of the main qwerty functions for computing
    the distance and match probabilities from the String::KeyboardDistance
    module. Please see the documentation for String::KeyboardDistance for
    more about these functions.

    Since these functions are implemented as XS, in C, they are
    significantly faster than the Perl based functions in
    String::KeyboardDistance. That is the primary reason for this module,
    performance.

  TODO

    This module only implements 2 of the functions from the Perl based
    module. We should match the API from the other module as well as
    possible. Some of the features will not be possible with this module,
    namely making the keyboard maps easily accessable to Perl code.

  EXPORT

    None by default. Functions are exported with the :all tag.
